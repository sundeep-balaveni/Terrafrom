## 🤔 we can create with Ansible , but why Terraform ?

You can create infrastructure with **Ansible**, but:

* ➡️ ansible can create duplicate resources , we cant manage the duplicate resources , it is good for configuration ⚙️

* ➡️ Terraform maintains state files which stores the current state of the cloud , where ansible does'nt 📂

* ➡️ Knows what to update or destroy 🔄

* ➡️ Terraform builds automatic dependency graph  [ VPC → Subnet → EC2 → Security Group ] 🏗️

  In ansible it will depends on the plays in written order
  But in Terraform it automatically creates all the required dependencies

* ➡️ WE can see what is going to create by `terraform plan` 👀

* ➡️ Designed for create → update → destroy lifecycle 🔁

  But ANsible we cant tear down fully

* ➡️ we can use for multiple cloud providers [aws, GCP , ] ☁️🌍
